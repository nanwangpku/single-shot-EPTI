Description:
Single-shot EPTI is a promising technique for fMRI studies. It provides distrotion-free multi-echo images for spin-echo (SE) or gradient-echo (GE) sequences, 
opening the door to Bold and non-Bold analysis.
Multiple datasets have been published for test purpose:

1. resting-state ss-EPTI
GE sequence
TR = 1.9 ms, TE = 5-65 ms, FA = 70
FOV = 216 x 216 mm2, matrix = 72x72, resolution = 3x3 mm2
number of slices > 42, slice thickness = 3 mm
SMS factor = 2

2. Visual flickeing experiment
GE sequence
TR = 1.9 ms, TE = 5-65 ms, FA = 70
FOV = 216 x 216 mm2, matrix = 72x72, resolution = 3x3 mm2
number of slices > 42, slice thickness = 3 mm
SMS factor = 2

2. Breath-holding experiment
GE sequence
TR = 1.9 ms, TE = 5-65 ms, FA = 70
FOV = 216 x 216 mm2, matrix = 72x72, resolution = 3x3 mm2
number of slices > 42, slice thickness = 3 mm
SMS factor = 2
